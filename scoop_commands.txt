# Install the PostgreSQL driver for scoop
scoop install psqlodbc

# Connect to the database using the psql command-line interface
psql -h hostname -U username -d database

# Once connected to the database, you can execute SQL queries to retrieve data
# For example, to retrieve all rows from a table called "customers"
SELECT * FROM customers;

# You can also use the -c option to execute a SQL query directly from the command line
psql -h hostname -U username -d database -c "SELECT * FROM customers"



This will retrieve all rows from the customers table and print the results to the console. You can then use the -o option to save the results to a file:




This will save the results to a CSV file called customers.csv. You can also use other output formats such as -A for ASCII table, -F to specify a field separator, -t to not include column headers, and -P to specify formatting options.



















psql -h hostname -U username -d database -c "SELECT * FROM customers" -o customers.csv
